        <p>
            Our website is focused on the youth. We want to provide locations of volunteering 
            opportunities for young people to look at and at least consider participating in one. 
            Our purpose is to inspire our peers to do more with their life because most do not realize 
            there is a lot more they can do than just being a student in school, doing house chores, and other
             typical things the youth do.

        <p>
            We are a group of aspiring website developers from New York City. This project was developed during the
            All Star Code Summer Intensive that taught us basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills we used to develop
            this website.
